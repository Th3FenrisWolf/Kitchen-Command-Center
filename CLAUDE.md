## Superpowers: plans & specs

Save Superpowers **plans** and **specs** under `.superpowers/`, not under `docs/superpowers/`. This keeps all superpowers files together in the same location.

- **Plans** → `.superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- **Specs / design docs** → `.superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`

A plan and the spec it implements **must share the identical `<slug>` only** — same slug, *potentially* different date. When writing a plan, derive its filename from its spec, updating the date to be the new current date; don't coin a new slug. Example: spec `2026-05-20-recipes.md` ↔ plan `2026-05-21-recipes.md`.

This overrides the default locations and filename placeholders baked into the `writing-plans` and `brainstorming` skills (`docs/superpowers/plans/` and `docs/superpowers/specs/`), both of which explicitly defer to user preferences for file location.

**`.superpowers/` is gitignored** (see `.gitignore`). The plan, spec, and brainstorm files are local scratch only — do **not** stage or commit them while working through a feature, and don't be surprised when they don't appear in `git status`. Leave them out of every commit.

## Vue SFC `<style>` blocks

Write component CSS in a `<style>` or `<style scoped>` block. A standalone CSS file is not required, and
adding one to work around missing styles is a symptom of a broken build, not a fix.

Style-block CSS never reaches the page as part of the SSR-rendered HTML, so each environment delivers it
separately:

- **Production** — the client build extracts it into chunk CSS assets (`GlobalComponents-*.css`). A
  `<link rel="stylesheet" vite-href="/Features/Main.ts">` in `Layout.cshtml` makes Vite.AspNetCore emit a
  `<link>` for every CSS file in the entry's import graph. Entries outside that graph need their own link —
  see `ResourceStringEditorTagHelper`.
- **Development** — no such asset exists, so the SSR sidecar walks the Vite SSR module graph after
  rendering, compiles each style module through the client pipeline, and returns the CSS alongside the
  HTML. `SsrHtmlContent` inlines it as `<style data-ssr-styles>`, and `Main.ts` removes that tag once
  hydration has run so HMR-updated head styles win.

**Always build both bundles together — `yarn build:all`, never one side alone.** Production scope IDs hash
each component's path *and* its content, so a client bundle built against different component source than
the SSR bundle emits `data-v-` attributes the CSS has no selectors for, and every scoped component
silently loses its styles.
