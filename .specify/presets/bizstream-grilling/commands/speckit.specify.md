description: Create or update the feature specification from a natural language description, grilling the user on every open decision rather than guessing.
strategy: wrap

## Before you begin

This command asks the user questions. The **Question protocol** at the end of this file replaces
how those questions get asked. Read this whole file before you act on any part of it.

{CORE_TEMPLATE}

## Question protocol

> This section is authoritative for every question this command puts to the user.
> Where anything above conflicts with it, this section wins.

One instruction in the command above is relaxed. The "Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers"
limit applies to markers you leave behind, not to questions you ask. Ask the frontier, settle what
the user answers, and leave a marker only for a decision they defer.

Interview the user until you reach a shared understanding. Adapted from Matt
Pocock's `grilling` skill (github.com/mattpocock/skills), MIT.

Map the open decisions as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the
decisions that hang off it. Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is
every decision whose prerequisites are already settled — the questions you can
ask *now* without guessing at answers you have not heard yet. Ask the whole
frontier in one round. Wait for the user's answers before the next round.

### Rules

- **Facts are your job, never the user's.** When a frontier question needs a
  fact from the environment (the repository, a linked document, an issue
  tracker, a database), dispatch a subagent or look it up yourself. Never ask
  the user for anything you can look up. A running lookup is an unsettled
  prerequisite: only its downstream questions wait; ask the rest of the
  frontier now.
- **Decisions are the user's.** Put each one to them with your recommended
  answer first, and wait.
- **A gate owned by someone else is never asked here.** When
  `.specify/memory/constitution.md` assigns a decision to a client or to a
  named human who is not in this session, that decision stays open. Record it
  as a GATED marker, recommend nothing binding, and move on.
- **A GATED marker is never asked.** `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: GATED — <owner>:
  <question>]` is the one form of a gate: a decision its owner holds outside
  this session. Never collect it into a round, never dedupe another question
  into it, and leave it verbatim. Only the owner's answer clears it.
- A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round
  belongs to a later round.
- Done when the frontier is empty: every branch visited, nothing silently
  assumed. Do not act until the user confirms shared understanding.

### Asking a round

Prefer the agent's own question affordance — `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code:
up to 4 questions per call, each with 2 to 4 options, your recommendation
listed first and marked `(Recommended)`. A frontier larger than 4 spans
consecutive calls in the same round. Dependency decides round membership, not
the 4-question cap.

Fall back to the markdown format below only when a question cannot be
expressed as options, because it is open-ended, needs a diagram, or needs long
context.

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, may be multiple paragraphs,
including choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Number questions across the whole session (Q1, Q2, …), never restarting per
round, so answers can reference them unambiguously.

### Batch mode

When the input is a set of artifacts rather than one — several specs, or their
collected `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers:

1. Collect every marker across all artifacts, except GATED markers.
2. **Dedupe.** Many artifacts share one underlying decision. One question,
   answered once, applies to every artifact it touches.
3. Sort the survivors into the design tree and run rounds as above.
4. After each round, apply the answers to every affected artifact before you
   ask the next round.
5. Anything the user defers stays a marker for a later `/speckit.clarify`.
