# Speckit Plan Skill

## Before you begin

This command asks the user questions. The **Question protocol** at the end of this file replaces
how those questions get asked. Read this whole file before you act on any part of it.


## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before planning)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_plan` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

## Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks

**You MUST complete this section before reporting completion to the user.**

Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it does not exist, or no hooks are registered under `hooks.after_plan`, skip to the Completion Report.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_plan` key.
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue to the Completion Report.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`) — **You MUST emit `EXECUTE_COMMAND:` for each mandatory hook**:
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

## Completion Report

Command ends after Phase 1 design. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - Document the contract format appropriate for the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Create quickstart validation guide** → `quickstart.md`:
   - Document runnable validation scenarios that prove the feature works end-to-end
   - Include prerequisites, setup commands, test/run commands, and expected outcomes
   - Use links or references to contracts and data model details instead of duplicating them
   - Do not include full implementation code, model/service/controller bodies, migrations, or complete test suites
   - Keep this artifact as a validation/run guide; implementation details belong in `tasks.md` and the implementation phase

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths for filesystem operations; use project-relative paths for references in documentation
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

## Done When

- [ ] Plan workflow executed and design artifacts generated
- [ ] Extension hooks dispatched or skipped according to the rules in Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks above
- [ ] Completion reported to user with branch, plan path, and generated artifacts


## Question protocol

> This section is authoritative for every question this command puts to the user.
> Where anything above conflicts with it, this section wins.

Where the command above prescribes how many questions to ask, in what format, or when to stop,
this section replaces it. Everything else it asks for stands.

Interview the user until you reach a shared understanding. Adapted from Matt
Pocock's `grilling` skill (github.com/mattpocock/skills), MIT.

Map the open decisions as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the
decisions that hang off it. Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is
every decision whose prerequisites are already settled — the questions you can
ask *now* without guessing at answers you have not heard yet. Ask the whole
frontier in one round. Wait for the user's answers before the next round.

### Rules

- **Facts are your job, never the user's.** When a frontier question needs a
  fact from the environment (the repository, a linked document, an issue
  tracker, a database), dispatch a subagent or look it up yourself. Never ask
  the user for anything you can look up. A running lookup is an unsettled
  prerequisite: only its downstream questions wait; ask the rest of the
  frontier now.
- **Decisions are the user's.** Put each one to them with your recommended
  answer first, and wait.
- **A gate owned by someone else is never asked here.** When
  `.specify/memory/constitution.md` assigns a decision to a client or to a
  named human who is not in this session, that decision stays open. Record it
  as a GATED marker, recommend nothing binding, and move on.
- **A GATED marker is never asked.** `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: GATED — <owner>:
  <question>]` is the one form of a gate: a decision its owner holds outside
  this session. Never collect it into a round, never dedupe another question
  into it, and leave it verbatim. Only the owner's answer clears it.
- A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round
  belongs to a later round.
- Done when the frontier is empty: every branch visited, nothing silently
  assumed. Do not act until the user confirms shared understanding.

### Asking a round

Prefer the agent's own question affordance — `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code:
up to 4 questions per call, each with 2 to 4 options, your recommendation
listed first and marked `(Recommended)`. A frontier larger than 4 spans
consecutive calls in the same round. Dependency decides round membership, not
the 4-question cap.

Fall back to the markdown format below only when a question cannot be
expressed as options, because it is open-ended, needs a diagram, or needs long
context.

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, may be multiple paragraphs,
including choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Number questions across the whole session (Q1, Q2, …), never restarting per
round, so answers can reference them unambiguously.

### Batch mode

When the input is a set of artifacts rather than one — several specs, or their
collected `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers:

1. Collect every marker across all artifacts, except GATED markers.
2. **Dedupe.** Many artifacts share one underlying decision. One question,
   answered once, applies to every artifact it touches.
3. Sort the survivors into the design tree and run rounds as above.
4. After each round, apply the answers to every affected artifact before you
   ask the next round.
5. Anything the user defers stays a marker for a later `/speckit.clarify`.
